LLM for chip design and semiconductors (make a viable product and then sell it to Tonyâ€™s company (heâ€™s going through a lot with a divorce right now))
LLM for computer and electronics â†’ ElectroMorphology
LLM for economics â†’ a RAG to break down economics and politics that is currently happening in the world (e.g. Donald Trump)
An AI AI engineer â†’ builds projects on its own, uses GitHub API â†’ can it beat Tom Zhang at a hackathon?

Physical AI projects:
AI-powered engineering tool (get creative and build one that solves the most niche problem in electrical, and mechanical engineers)
AI robotic project (you can consult Aurick about it)
