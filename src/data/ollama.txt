wrote and published "A Practical Guidebook to Ollama"
authored Jupyter notebooks on a GitHub repo that had over [number] stars

conducted an AI and data science program at Columbia University
where we assigned more than 64 graduate students to test out 
foundational models, and Ollama which gave us invaluable insights
to my book "A Practical Guidebook to Ollama"

will (hopefully) host an Ollama hackathon on Columbia University campus

- Packt will be there
- Ollama (company) will be there too
