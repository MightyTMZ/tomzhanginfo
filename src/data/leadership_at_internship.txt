At Token Z Labs, my boss had trouble raising funds 
he wanted to put legal documents on the website but 
did not know how to do that.

so I took leadership and became proactive, spent 3+ hours formating the

- General Disclaimer
- Privacy Policy (USA)
- Privacy Policy (Canada)
- Terms and Conditions
- Risk Disclosures
- Cookies Policy

into equitable markup for investors, regulators, clients, etc. 

I formatted it in the footer
and it was a sum of 55 pages of legal notes

after this:

an ex J.P. Morgan person from California agreed to put his
property listings on the Token Z Labs platform due to the visible
disclosures of the legal agenda

a company from LA (a less competitive city than NYC) agreed to invest
to get on a meeting with us (i'm not sure if they invested or not)
