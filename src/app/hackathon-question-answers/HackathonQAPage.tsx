    answer: `I would build space-based data centers powered by Dyson spheres. 
    This harnesses stellar energy to run massive AI systems. 
    The best part? No need to for cooling! The freezing temperature of space works! 
    This OPENS up the possibility of running computations that model climate, optimize
     resource distribution, and accelerate scientific breakthroughs globally, tackling
      energy scarcity, environmental crises, and infrastructure challenges at scale. 
      All of this done without taxing Earthâ€™s resources.

    I aim to leverage HackHarvard to build innovative projects while learning
     from top peers. Iâ€™m eager to deepen my expertise in full-stack development, 
     AI/ML integration, DevOps integration and scalable product design. 
     I plan to collaborate intensively, push creative boundaries, and refine
      my coding, prototyping, and pitching skills. My goal is to leave with
       stronger technical proficiency, a broader network, and actionable insights
        to accelerate my ventures.

    answer: `I was a part of a summer program called HUVTSP. A big problem I realized as 
    I was in the program was people were searching for leads and startup projects to 
    join in so many disconnected apps and channels. Therefore, I created a semantic
     search engine app to connect students and their ventures. Best of all, people 
     began searching for each other like using Google. As of August 2025, we have 
     already help connect over 350 alumni and over 20 startup projects.
